## How to Implement This

1. **Transactional Email Service:**

Use a service like [Resend](https://resend.com/), [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/), [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/), or [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/) (if you have your own SMTP server) to send the email when someone joins the waitlist.

2. **Trigger Email on Waitlist Signup:**
   - After successfully adding the email to the waitlist table, call your email-sending function with the user's email and the above content.

## Would You Like Me To:
- Set up a simple Node.js/TypeScript function using Resend (free for low volume, easy to use)?
- Or do you have a preferred email provider (SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.)?

Let me know your preference, and I'll implement the integration and the email content for you!
