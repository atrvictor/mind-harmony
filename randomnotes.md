## Note: MusicIcon in Mind Harmony Project

- The `MusicIcon` is not a custom file in the projectâ€”it is an icon component imported from the `lucide-react` icon library.
- **Source:**
  - `MusicIcon` comes from the `lucide-react` package, which provides a set of SVG icon components for React.
- **Usage:**
  - Imported in code as: `import { MusicIcon } from "lucide-react";`
- **No local file:**
  - There is no file like `MusicIcon.tsx` or `music-icon.svg` in the project. The icon is bundled with the `lucide-react` npm package.
- **To see or customize the source:**
  - You can view the [lucide-react Music icon source on GitHub](https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide/blob/main/icons/music.svg).
  - Or copy the SVG code from their repo or documentation if you want to use or customize it directly.
