# Mind Harmony Project: Key Actions & Outcomes

**UI/UX Improvements:**
- Navigation bar logo/text aligned left by adjusting padding/margin.
- Event dates updated to 2025 on all relevant pages.
- "Get Tickets" for Candlelight Yoga links to Eventbrite; other events show "Coming Soon" and are disabled.
- "La Jolla" location shown only for Candlelight Yoga after date/time.
- Homepage auto-scrolls smoothly to Candlelight Yoga event, with user-interrupt and slower speed as requested.

**Forms & Supabase Integration:**
- Waitlist form (email-only) adds to `waitlist` table.
- Community registration form (name, email, interest) uses Supabase Auth (magic link) and stores metadata.
- "Set Password" button on profile page sends password reset email for users to set a password later.
- User deletion from both Supabase Auth and waitlist tables as needed.

**Error Handling & Feedback:**
- Duplicate email errors now display clear, user-friendly messages.
- Unique constraint violations are handled gracefully.

**Email Confirmation:**
- Confirmation email content for waitlist signups drafted and saved to `email.md`.
- Recommendations provided for sending emails (Resend, SendGrid, etc.).

**Deployment & Best Practices:**
- All changes deployed to Vercel.
- Provided guidance on React, Supabase, and general best practices for registration, error handling, and email flows.

If you need further changes, want to implement the waitlist confirmation email, or have new features in mind, just let me know!
